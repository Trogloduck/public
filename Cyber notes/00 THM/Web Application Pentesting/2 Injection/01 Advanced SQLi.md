[[11 SQL Injection|SQLi basics]]

***Reminder***
##### In-band SQLi
Same communication channel for injection and data retrieval
- **Error-based:** manipulate SQL query to produce error
- **Union-based:** combine results of 2+ SELECT statements to retrieve data
##### Inferential (Blind) SQLi
No direct transfer of data via webapp, send payload > observe app behavior - response time
- **Boolean-based:** send query, force app to return different result based on true/false condition, infer if condition was met or not based on page content/behavior
- **Time-based:** send query which delays response if true
##### Out-of-band SQLi
Cannot use same channel to launch attack and gather data / unstable server responses
Database server makes out-of-band requests (e.g. : HTTP, DNS) to send query result

### 2nd-Order SQLi
[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

AKA stored SQLi: user input saved, subsequently used in different part of app, possibly after being processed
Injection occurs when data is retrieved and used in SQL command

*Books review example*
SQLi doesn't get executed when adding the book, but when updating the book information
