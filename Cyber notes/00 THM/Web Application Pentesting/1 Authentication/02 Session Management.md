Lifecycle
1. **Creation:** after providing credentials, sometimes even before because web app tracks actions regardless of authentication
2. **Tracking:** session value is submitted with each request
3. **Timeout / Expiry:** session value should have lifetime attached to it
4. **Termination:** after logout

1. **Identification:** verifying *who* user is --> ***username***
2. **Authentication:** verifying user is who they *claim* they are --> ***password***
3. **Authorization:** allocating adequate *rights* to authenticated user
4. **Accountability:** creating record of user actions

***IAAA and Sessions Management:** authentication plays role in session creation, authorization plays role in what actions user can perform, accountability makes sure each user action can be connected to a session*
