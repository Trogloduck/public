### Token-Based Authentication
[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

Cookie: built-in function in browser
Token: client-side JS, stores in browser's LocalStorage, then loads it from storage and attaches it with each request as a header
Common types of token: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), passed through `Authorization: Bearer` header

___
### JWT
[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

3 base64 url encoded elements, separated by dots
- **Header:** type of token (JWT), signing algorithm used
- **Payload:** body, contains claims (pieces of info, public/private)
- **Signature:** verify token authenticity

Signing algorithms
- **None:** n/a
- **Symmetric Signing:** append secret value to header and body, then hash (e.g. HS256)
- **Asymmetric Signing:** hash header and body, encrypt hash with private key (e.g. RS256)

Encrypted JWT = JWE
