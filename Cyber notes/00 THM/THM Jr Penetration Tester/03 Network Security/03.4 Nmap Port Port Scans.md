--> use any or a group of those scripts / install other scripts

`--script=default` / `-sC`: use all scripts from default category
`--script "SCRIPT_NAME"`
`--script "PATTERN*"`

Other categories: auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, vuln

___
### Saving the Output
[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

Main formats
- **`-oN FILENAME`** -- *Normal*: similar to output
- **`-oG FILENAME`** -- *Grepable* (grep: global regular expression printer): more efficient filtering
- **`-oX FILENAME`** -- *XML*: most convenient for interoperability (other programs)
- **`-oA FILENAME`** : save in all 3 formats

Script Kiddie (not really useful)
**`-oS FILENAME`**: converts into 1337 5p34k
