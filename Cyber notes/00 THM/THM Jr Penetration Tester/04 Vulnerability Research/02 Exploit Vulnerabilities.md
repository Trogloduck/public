### Automated VS Manual

Examples: Nessus ([THM room](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux)), [[2.1 Metasploit - Intro|Metasploit]]'s modules

**Automated** tools are **loud**, **not good to bypass firewall**

Manual scanning is preferred when having a specific target

### Manual Exploits

**Rapid7**, similar to Exploit-DB and NVD: Vulnerability Database, but also exploit database

**GitHub**: useful to find rare/new exploits

**Searchsploit**: available on Kali, offline copy of Exploit-DB
