### Vulnerability Scoring - CVSS & VPR
[[#Table of content|Back to the top]]

Few vulnerabilities end up being exploited (2%, trust me bro)--> need to prioritize --> scoring

**CVSS** -- Common Vulnerability Scoring System
1. Exploitation ease
2. Exploits existence
3. CIA impact

[CVSS calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

Minority of vulnerabilities have exploits (20%, trust me bro)

**VPR** -- Vulnerability Priority Rating
More modern, more adequate for vulnerability management, risk-driven, more dynamic in scoring, adapts more to organization
