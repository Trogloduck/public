*Weakness/flaw in design, implementation / behaviors of system / application*

Vulnerabilities types
- **OS** --> privilege escalation
- **Configuration-based**
- **Weak/default credentials**
- **Application logic**
- **Human factor**

### Vulnerability Scoring - CVSS & VPR
[[#Table of content|Back to the top]]

Few vulnerabilities end up being exploited (2%, trust me bro)--> need to prioritize --> scoring

**CVSS** -- Common Vulnerability Scoring System
1. Exploitation ease
2. Exploits existence
3. CIA impact

[CVSS calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

Minority of vulnerabilities have exploits (20%, trust me bro)

**VPR** -- Vulnerability Priority Rating
More modern, more adequate for vulnerability management, risk-driven, more dynamic in scoring, adapts more to organization

___
### Vulnerability Databases
[[#Table of content|Back to the top]]

1. [NVD -- National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln)
Lists publicly categorized vulnerabilities, under CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Format: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER

2. [Exploit-DB](http://exploit-db.com/)
More helpful to look for specific vulnerability against specific target
