`pip install`: installing something from https://pypi.org/

/!\\ careful what package I install: it can run code as soon as it is installed 
and there is **no moderation on pypi.org**!

Every package has a "setup.py" file that runs as soon as we run the `pip install the_package` command

Check content of setup.py: download and examine it in VSCode (no `pip install`)
