*No entity inside or outside organization's network should be inherently trusted*

Minimize the "attack surface", reduce potential impact of security breaches

1. Verify **Identity**: not necessarily human, can be device/application/...
2. **Least Privilege**: reduce attack surface, risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, accidental misuse of privileges
3. **Micro-Segmentation**: limit lateral movement
4. Continuous **Monitoring**
5. Data **Encryption**
6. Strict **Access Control**

#### Differences from traditional security architecture

1. **Perimeter**-centric: trusted once inside
   
   **Identity**-centric: threat can origine from inside too
2. **Implicit** Trust: implicit trust of devices inside network
   
   **Explicit** Trust: verifies identities, continuous monitoring for anomalies
3. **Flat** Network: broad access
   
   **Segmented** Network: small isolated zones, facilitates containment
4. **Reactive**: firewalls, intrusion detection
   
   **Proactive**: breaches are likely, minimize their impact

#### Defense in Depth
AKA Layered Security

Deploying multiple layers of security controls

Combination of technical, procedural, physical
