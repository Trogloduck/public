#### Containers
Lightweight, standalone software packages including everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, system tools. They provide consistent, isolated environment, simplifying development, packaging, and deployment across different platforms. Popular container technologies are Docker and Kubernetes.

Container introduce vulnerabilities:
1. **Image Security**
- Scanning images for known vulnerabilities and ensuring that only trusted images are used
2. **Runtime Security**
- Running containers must be isolated from each other and the host system to prevent unauthorized access and potential attacks. Container isolation technologies (namespaces, cgroups), tools for monitoring and auditing container behavior.
3. **Network Security**
- Network segmentation and firewall rules are essential to control traffic between containers
4. **Access Control**
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and identity management tools
5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- ...
6. **Orchestration Security**
- Securing Kubernetes API server, ensuring proper RBAC policies, auditing cluster activity
7. **Secrets Management**
- Secure storage and management solutions for handling sensitive information such as API keys and passwords
