#### SIEM
Security Information and Event Management

1. **Log Collection**: devices, systems, applications (firewalls, intrusion detection, antivirus, ...)
2. **Data Normalization**: common format to facilitate analysis
3. **Event Correlation**: identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate security incidents or threats
4. **Alerting and Notification**: in real time, allowing for immediate response
5. **Incident Detection**: unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, insider threats
6. **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)**: identify abnormal entity behaviors
7. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: integrate with threat intelligence feeds to enhance threat detection by comparing known IOCs (Indicators Of Compromise) with network activity
8. **Automation and Orchestration**: automate responses to common security incidents
9. **Dashboard and Visualization**
10. **Integration with Other Security Tools**: EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, ...

#### [[XDR]]
eXtended Detection and Response: extends EDR capabilities, broader security telemetry

1. **Data Integration**: multiple sources (endpoints, network traffic, cloud services, email, ...)
2. **Advanced Analytics**: machine learning, behavioral analysis, looks for patterns and anomalies in the integrated data to detect both known and unknown threats
3. **Automated Threat Detection**: correlating information from various sources, can identify complex attack chains that may span multiple vectors
4. **Incident Investigation and Response**: assess scope and impact of incidents and take appropriate remedial actions
5. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: IOCs
6. **Unified Console**: centralized info in dashboard
7. **Cross-Platform Coverage**: endpoints, servers, cloud environments, mobile devices

In addition to SIEM:

1. **Machine Learning and AI**
2. **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)**
3. **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
4. **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**: automate incident response and streamline security operations workflows
5. **Deception Technologies**: mislead and detect attackers within the network
