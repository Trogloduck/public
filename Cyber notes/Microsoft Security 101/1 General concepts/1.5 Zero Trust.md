*No entity inside or outside organization's network should be inherently trusted*

Minimize the "attack surface", reduce potential impact of security breaches

1. Verify **Identity**: not necessarily human, can be device/application/...
2. **Least Privilege**: reduce attack surface, risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, accidental misuse of privileges
3. **Micro-Segmentation**: limit lateral movement
4. Continuous **Monitoring**
5. Data **Encryption**
6. Strict **Access Control**

#### Differences from traditional security architecture

|                      | Perimeter-centric                            | Identity-centric                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust Assumption** | Trusted once inside                          | Threat can originate from inside too                 |
| **Trust**            | **Implicit** inside                          | **Explicit**: ID verification, continuous monitoring |
| **Network**          | **Flat**: broad access                       | **Segmented**: small isolated zones for containment  |
| **Posture**          | **Reactive**: firewalls, intrusion detection | **Proactive**: breaches are likely, minimize impact  |

AKA Layered Security

Deploying multiple layers of security controls
