Threat: anything that could compromise [[1.1 CIA triad]]

#### Motives
1. Mon€¥ (credit card, ransomware, ...)
2. Espionnage (nations, competitors, ...)
3. Sabotage (political/ideological)
5. Ideology (hacktivism/other)
6. Unintentional

#### Most common threats
1. **Phishing**
2. **Malware**
   - **Ransomware**: encrypt data, decryption key against ransom
   - **Trojan**: pose as legitimate software, give attacker unauthorized access
   - **Virus**: attache to legitimate file/program and replicates and spreads when file/program is executed
   - **Worm**: self-replicating standalone program that spreads by itself through networks
3. **DoS** (Denial of Service) and **DDoS** (Distributed Denial of Service): overload target to render is unavailable, either single source or multiple (distributed)
4. **SQL Injection**: exploit web app's input fields
5. **XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting): inject malicious script into web app, then executed by other user
6. **Social Engineering**: exploit human psychology
7. **0day** (Zero-Day Exploits): exploit unknown vulnerability
8. **Credential Attacks**: brute force, credential studding attacks (stolen from another site)

#### MITRE ATT&CK framework
**Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**: catalogs and categorizes **tactics**, **techniques** and **procedures** (TTPs) used by adversaries

Standardized description-analysis of threats
1. Understand **Adversarial Behavior**: adversaries steps from initial entry to achieving objectives
2. Plan and Implement **Defense Strategies**: consistent with adversaries TTPs
3. **Incident Response** and **Threat Hunting**: reactive and proactive SecOps

MITRE ATT&CK framework organizes threats according to
- **Environments**: Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud services
- **Tactics**: high-level goals, such as initial access, privilege escalation, exfiltration
- **Techniques**: specific methods
