### Definitions
#### Threat Agent
***Who?*** Has potential to exploit [vulnerabilities](#vulnerability). 

Can be anything: individual, group, automated system, ...
#### Threat
***What***? Potential event/action that can exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm to an [asset](#asset). 

Can be: hacking, data breach, DoS, ...
#### Vulnerability
Weakness/Flaw in design of system/implementation/configuration, can be exploited. 

Can be found in: software, hardware, processes, people.
#### Risk
Potential for loss/damage resulting from threat meeting vulnerability. Often assessed in terms of potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. 
#### Asset
Anything of value, needs to be protected. 

Can be: physical objects, data, intellectual property, human ressources. 
#### Exposure
State of being vulnerable to a threat.
#### Control
Measure put in place to reduce risk associated with vulnerabilities and threats. 

Designed to: prevent, detect, mitigate potential vulnerabilities and threats. 

Can be: technical, procedural, administrative.

>*To summarize the relationship between these terms: **Threat agents** exploit **vulnerabilities** to carry out **threats**, which can lead to **risks** that have the potential to cause harm to valuable **assets**. **Exposure** occurs when **vulnerabilities** are present, and **controls** are put in place to reduce the **risk** by preventing or mitigating the impact of **threats** on **assets**.*

### Types of security controls

Categories vary depending on *focus* and *purpose*:

1. **Administrative** Controls
- Security **policies** and **procedures**
- Security **awareness training**
- Incident **response** and **management**

2. **Technical** Controls
- **Access controls**: restrict access to ressources
- **Encryption**
- **Firewalls**: filter-control incoming and outgoing traffic
- **IDPS** (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems): monitor traffic for suspicious activity
- **Antivirus** and **anti-malware**
- **Authentication** mechanisms: verify identity
- **Patch** management: update

3. **Physical** Controls
- Security **guards** - access control personnel
- Surveillance **cameras**
- **Locks** and physical **barriers**
- **Environmental** controls: regulate TÂ°, humidity, ...

4. **Operational** Controls
- **Change** management: tracking and approving changes to systems and configurations
- **Backup** and disaster **recovery**
- **Logging** and auditing
- Secure **coding** practices

5. **Legal** and **Regulatory** Controls
- **Data protection** regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, ...)
- **Industry**-specific standards (ISO, ...)

### Assessing security risks
1. Identify **Assets** and **Threats**
2. Assess **Vulnerabilities**
3. **Likelihood** (of each threat) Assessment (low, medium, high): based on historical data, threat intelligence, industry trends, internal factors
4. **Impact** Assessment (low, medium, high): financial loss, operational disruption, reputational damage, legal consequences, ...
5. **Risk Calculation** (low, medium, high): combination of likelihood and impact, often calculated through matrix that assigns numerical or qualitative descriptors to likelihood and impact
6. **Prioritization** and **Decision**-Making
7. **Risk Treatment**: implementation of the decisions taken
8. Continuous **Monitoring** and **Review**
