___
#### Access reviews

Ensure only right people have access to resources

When to use access reviews
- **Too many users in privileged roles**: check \# users with admin access, invited guests /partners that haven't been removed after being assigned to admin task
- **Business critical data access**: for certain resources, part of compliance processes to ask people to regularly reconfirm and give a justification on why they need continued access
- **Maintain a policy's exception list**: manage exception and provide auditors with proof that exceptions are reviewed regularly
- **Ask group owners to confirm they still need guests in their groups**
- **Have reviews recur periodically**

Up to 3 review stages: different types of reviewers at each stage, reduce \# decisions each reviewer has to make
