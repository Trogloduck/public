| Aspect                                  | AI Security                                                                         | Traditional Cybersecurity                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Integrity**                      | Ensuring data integrity to prevent data poisoning                                   | Focus on securing data from unauthorized access or tampering |
| **Model Security**                      | Protecting AI model from reverse-engineering and exploitation                       | Securing software and systems from hacking and malware       |
| **Adversarial Attacks**                 | Susceptible to adversarial attacks affecting predictions                            | Primarily direct attacks: malware, phishing                  |
| **Infrastructure Security**             | Additional layers such as cloud services and specialized hardware                   | Securing networks, servers, and endpoints                    |
| **Ethical Considerations**              | Addressing privacy, bias, and fairness in AI                                        | Less focus on ethical implications                           |
| **Complexity of Threats**               | Vulnerable to novel threats like adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model evasion | Primarily malware, phishing, network intrusions              |
| **Attack Surface**                      | Larger because not just software, also rely on data and models                      | Smaller, focusing on software and networks                   |
| **Adaptability of Threats**             | Adaptive and evolving threats specific to AI                                        | Static threats that evolve more slowly                       |
| **Interpretability and Explainability** | Challenging to understand AI decisions                                              | Easier to understand software behavior and responses         |
| **Data Privacy Concerns**               | High due to reliance on large data sets                                             | Privacy concerns but less critical than in AI                |
| **Regulatory Compliance**               | Evolving regulations specific to AI security                                        | Established cybersecurity regulations                        |
| **Ethical Considerations**              | Ensuring ethical use, fairness, transparency, accountability                        | Ethical issues are less prominent                            |

Traditional principles used in AI systems
- **Threat Protection**: safeguard against unauthorized access, data modification, destruction, other common threats
- **Vulnerability Management**: many vulnerabilities affecting traditional systems (software bugs, misconfigurations) can impact AI systems
- **Data Security**: prevent data breaches, ensure confidentiality
- **Supply Chain Security**: supply chain attacks, a compromised component undermines security of entire system
