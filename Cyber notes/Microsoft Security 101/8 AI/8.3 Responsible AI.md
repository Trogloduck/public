AI development and use in a way that benefits individuals, communities, society
- **Ethical Considerations**: privacy, data protection
- **Robustness and Reliability**: against manipulation and attacks (> adversarial attacks), ensuring AI decision-making processes integrity
- **Transparency and Explainability**: understanding > trusting
- **Accountability**: trace decisions, rectify issues
___

Secure and ethical AI practical measures
- **Ethical Principles**: human, societal, and environmental wellbeing; fairness; privacy protection; reliability; transparency; contestability; and accountability
- **Robust Security Measures**: proactive security testing and AI trust, risk, security management programs
- **Diverse Stakeholders**: wide range of participants in AI development process, including ethicists, social scientists, and representatives from affected communities to ensure diverse perspectives and values are considered
- **Transparency and Explainability**: AI’s decision-making processes are transparent and can be explained > greater trust, easier identification of biases/errors
- **Data Privacy**: encryption and other data protection measures
- **Human Oversight**: contestability of AI decisions, accountability
- **Stay Informed on AI Safety**
- **Comply with Regulations**: laws and regulations (data protection laws, anti-discrimination laws, and industry-specific guidelines)
___

Concrete examples of unethical AI use
- **Biased Decision-Making**: perpetuate and amplify existing biases if AI is trained on biased data sets
- **AI in Judicial Systems**: AI’s decision-making process may lack transparency or be influenced by biased data leading to unfair treatment
- **Manipulation of AI Systems**: adversarial attacks, slight modifications to input data can cause incorrect outcomes. For example, autonomous vehicles could be misled to misinterpret traffic signs, leading to safety risks.
- **AI-Powered Surveillance**: privacy violations, especially if used without proper consent or in ways that infringe on individual freedoms
