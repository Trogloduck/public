#### Network segmentation
Dividing network into smaller segments/subnets, using technologies such as VLANs, firewalls and access controls

Reduces attack surface, minimizes potential damage by security incident
#### E2E (End-to-End) Encryption
Data remains encrypted throughout entire journey. Encryption and decryption occur only at the endpoints.

#### SASE
Secure Access Service Edge: framework-architecture combining network security and WAN (Wide-Area Networking) capabilities into single cloud-based service

Characteristics
- **Cloud**-Based
- Integration of **Security** and **Networking**: SWG (Secure Web Gateways), FWaaS (FireWall as a Service), DLP (Data Loss Prevention), ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access), WAN optimization
- **Zero Trust**
- **Identity-Centric**
- **Scalability** and **Flexibility**

**Criticism**
Neither a new market, technology nor product, but rather an integration of existing technology with a single source of management.
