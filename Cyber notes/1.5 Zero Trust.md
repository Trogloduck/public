*No entity inside or outside organization's network should be inherently trusted*

Minimize the "attack surface", reduce potential impact of security breaches

1. Verify **Identity**: not necessarily human, can be device/application/...
2. **Least Privilege**
3. **Micro-Segmentation**: limit lateral movement
4. Continuous **Monitoring**
5. Data **Encryption**
6. Strict **Access Control**

#### Differences from traditional security architecture

1. Perimeter- vs Identity-Centric
   
   Perimeter: trusted once inside
   
   Identity: threat can origine from inside too
2. Implicit vs Explicit Trust
   
   Implicit: implicit trust of devices inside network
   
   Explicit: verifies identities, continuous monitoring for anomalies
3. Flat vs Segmented Network
   
   Flat: broad access
   
   Segmented: small isolated zones, facilitates containment
4. Reactive vs Proactive
   
   Reactive: firewalls, intrusion detection
   
   Proactive: breaches are likely, minimize their impact
