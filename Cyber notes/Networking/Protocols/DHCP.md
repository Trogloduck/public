Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: 
- DHCP **discover**: device enters a network and sends a request to be assigned an IP
	- DHCP **offer**: response of DHCP server with an IP offer
		- DHCP **request**: formal request of the IP offered
			- DHCP **ACK**: server sends reply acknowledging it’s done
(all those pieces of data that are sent to each other are called packets)

Ex: Server uses DHCP to assign IP to Wi-Fi box
