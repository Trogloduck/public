Internet Protocol address, used to identify device on network, can change, referred to as logical identifier

IP addresses follow sets of standardized rules called protocols to allow them to work with each other

IPv6 can sustain way more IP addresses than IPv4 ($2^{128}$ vs $2^{32}$)

The protocol:
- connectionless: does not make connection with destination before sending packet
- does not allow to follow packets --> no receipt acknowledgement 
- independent of medium on which it is used but adapts  size of packets
- IP header: IP addresses of source and destination

Types of IP: 
- [[IPv4]]
- [[IPv6]]
