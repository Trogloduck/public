< [[00 OSI]]

Enables communication between applications on different devices

Main functions:
1. **Session Management**: establishes and maintains *communication session* between applications
2. **Data Segmentation**: *segments* large data into smaller chunks that fit the [[3. Network]] layer protocols
3. **Application Identification**: assigns unique *port* numbers to each application to ensure data is sent and received by the correct one

Additionally, the transport layer uses **headers** on each data chunk for:
- **Order Reconstruction**: ensure the received data is *reassembled* in the correct order
- **Multiplexing**: *share* the network bandwidth efficiently among multiple applications
___

**Transport protocols**

**[[TCP]]** (Transmission Control Protocol): ***checks*** if you actually received data and resends it if you didnâ€™t, ensures more ***integrity*** of data thanks to ***error checking***
--> file sharing, internet browsing, email sending/receiving

**[[UDP]]** (User Datagram Protocol): ***faster*** and more adequate for ***real-time*** data sharing
--> multiplayer FPS game for instance, while when you open a shop it would use TCP; videocall
