These are exercise websites designed in the context of a course about phishing. The websites are designed to phish for credentials based on information gathered about the targets:

- Bob has a dog (a bull terrier) named "Shimi". Bob really loves his dog.
- Alice is a fan of MÃ©canique. She has two vintage cars and often likes to parade around with her ancestral objects.

The HTML pages are just very simple examples of what could be done using HTML code. It would be very unlikely to succeed in collecting credentials that way obviously. 

In order to actually succeed, the website would be a lot more sophisticated and more time would be required to develop it. A proper HTML email would also have to be crafted in order to achieve a professional and convincing look.

Example ideas for a more complete project: 
- "***Dogbook***": Social network for dogs, the users impersonate their dogs and post content related to (their) dogs. In order for the website to look legitimate, having a few bogus accounts that have already posted. We can create an incentive to login by using a similar strategy to instagram: you have to login to "view more" or to click on a post.
- **False federated identity provider**: pretend that the user has the possibility of using credentials from another service in order to login (facebook, google, microsoft outlook, etc.) The login popup page must look identical to other federated identity providers in order to convince the users to use their credentials. This would provide a seemingly legitimate reason for users to use their other credentials and provide a false sense of security doing so.

- **HTML email invitation**: to recruit "growing community of dog enthusiasts", email must have same ***color scheme*** and ***fonts*** as the website for consistency and professional look.
- **Personalized invitation**: include a false profile overview of what Shimi's profile could look like (with a justification "our AI system scours the internet for dog friends") giving further incentive to log into the website. 

A similar idea can be used for Alice. The idea can be modified in order to suit her interest. The website could appear to have a sale section for instance.

The PHP file created to gather the credentials is not currently working. In the future, PHP code should be used to make the PHP file work.
