# Part 1

Discreet probability is always defined over a **universe**

U: **finite set**

For instance, 

   U = {0,1}$^n$

   {0,1}$^2$ = {00,01,10,11}

**Probability distribution** is a function P over U that assigns a number between 0 and 1 to each **element** of the universe

   P: U $\rightarrow$ \[0,1]

   such that    $\sum\limits_{x \in U} P(x) = 1$

## Examples of distributions

### Uniform distribution

   $\forall$ x $\in$ U:    P(x) = 1/|U|

(all x have the same probability that is determined on the number of elements in U)

### Point distribution at $x_0$

   P($x_0$) = 1,    $\forall$ x $\neq$ $x_0$:  P(x) = 0

## Distribution vector

Because we're going to deal with finite sets, we can write down the weights the distribution assigns to each element in U, and represent the entire distribution as a vector:

   (P($x_1$), P($x_2$), P($x_3$), ... , P($x_n$))  $\in \mathbb{R}^n$ 

## Events

For a set  A $\subset$ U:    Pr\[A] = $\sum\limits_{x \in A} P(x) \in [0,1]$

The set A is called an **event**

**Example**:    U = {0,1}$^8$    *# all 8 bit string*

   |U| = $2^8$ = 256

   A = { all x in U such that lsb$_2$(x) = 11 }    $\subseteq$ U    *# lsb: least significant bits*

(nnnn nn11)

for the uniform distribution on {0,1}$^8$: Pr\[A] =2$^6$ / 2$^8$ = 1/4

## The union bound

For events A_1 and A_2  $\subseteq$ U

   Pr\[ $A_1 \cup A_2$ ] $\leq$ Pr\[$A_1$] + Pr\[$A_2$]

*The probability that either $A_1$ or $A_2$ occurs is less or equal to the sum of their respective probabilities because $A_1$ and $A_2$ could be overlapping*

## Random Variables

**Definition**: a random variable X is a function    X: U $\rightarrow$ V

**X takes values in the set V and defines a distribution on the set V**

**Example**: 

   X: {0,1}$^n$ $\rightarrow$ {0,1}    ;    X(y) = lsb(y)  $\in$ {0,1}

### The uniform random variable

Let U be some set, e.g.  U = {0,1}$^n$

**Example**:

We write  r $\xleftarrow{\text{R}}$ U  to denote a uniform random variable over U

   $\forall$ a $\in$ U:  Pr\[ r = a ] = 1/|U|

(formally, r is the identity function:    r(x) = x    for all x $\in$ U)

**Example**:

   U = {0,1}$^2$

   r $\xleftarrow{\text{R}}$ U

Random variable:    X = $r_1$ + $r_2$

What is the probability that X = 2?

It is equal to the probability that both bits are equal 1 = 1/4

## Randomized algorithms

Deterministic algorithm:  y $\leftarrow$ A(m)

*Algorithm A takes input m and outputs y systematically*

Randomized algorithm:

   y $\leftarrow$ A( m ; r )    where    r $\xleftarrow{\text{R}}$ {0,1}$^n$

*Algorithm A takes input m and implicit argument r and r is anew every time the algorithm runs*

Output y is a random variable which is defining a distributionÂ over the set of all possible outputs of this algorithm, given the input m

# Part 2

## Independence

Events A and B are independent if if event A happens, that tells nothing about whether event B happened or not

   Pr\[ A and B ] = Pr\[A] \* Pr\[B]

The same thing can be said about random variables. For X, Y random variables taking values in V and independent: 

   $\forall$ a, b $\in$ V:    Pr\[ X=a and Y=B ] = Pr\[X=a] \* Pr\[Y=b]

**Example**:    U = {0,1}$^2$ = {00, 01, 10, 11}    and    r $\xleftarrow{\text{R}}$ U

   X = lsb(r)   ;   Y = msb(r)

*If I know whether X=0 or X=1, that tells me nothing about the value of Y*

   Pr\[ X=0 and Y=0 ] = Pr\[ r=00 ] = 1/4 = Pr\[X=0] \* Pr\[Y=0]

## XOR

**Definition**:

   x $\oplus$ y = (x+y) mod 2

| x   | y   | x $\oplus$ y |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0            |
| 0   | 1   | 1            |
| 1   | 0   | 1            |
| 1   | 1   | 0            |

   x = y $\Rightarrow$ x $\oplus$ y = 0

   x $\neq$ y $\Rightarrow$ x $\oplus$ y = 1

*A common joke is that the only thing cryptographers know how to do is just XOR things together*
