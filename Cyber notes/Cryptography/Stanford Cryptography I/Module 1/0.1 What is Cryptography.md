# How it does it

1. Secret key establishment
2. Secure communication
Provides **confidentiality** and **integrity**

# What it can do

**Digital signature**: the signature is a **function** of the document being signed --> can't be copy pasted on other documents

**Anonymous communication**, for instance using a ***mix net***: messages get encrypted and decrypted through a series of proxies

**Anonymous digital cash**: allows to spend money anonymously, prevents double spending

### Secure multi-party computation

Each participant has a secret input

Goal: compute f($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, ... , $x_n$)

Dumb solution: 
1. Trusted authority collects inputs, promises to keep confidentiality
2. Calculates and publishes result

**/!\\** *Anything that can be done with a trusted authority can be also (and should be) done without a trusted authority*

**Elections**
- Anonymous
- Only allowed voters
- No double voting
- Calculates result

Private **auctions**, example: Vickrey auction
- Anonymous and unknown bids
- Only 2 informations made public: highest bidder pays 2nd highest bid

# Crypto magic

**Privately outsourcing computation**: *The server can compute on encrypted data without knowing exactly what's in the encrypted data*

For instance, we could send web requests anonymously without the server knowing what we want: 
1. A sends query to B
2. B receives query but doesn't know it's A who sent it
3. B doesn't know what exactly is the query but still solves it
4. B sends back result to A without knowing it's sending it to A

NB: this is only theoretical and for now can only be applied to simpler computations

**Zero knowledge**, example: zero knowledge proof of knowledge

N = p\*q (p and q are very big prime numbers)

A and B know the number N. A can prove to B that it knows the factorisation of N without B knowing that factorisation

# Rigorous science

- Precisely specify **threat model**: what an ***attacker*** can do forging a signature and what their goal is, what does it mean for a signature to be unforgeable
- **Propose construction**
- Prove that **breaking construction** under threat model will solve an underlying **hard problem**
