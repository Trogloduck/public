[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

Set of tools used for information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, ...

Main components
- **msfconsole**: main CLI
- **Modules**: supporting modules built to perform specific task (exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.)
- **Tools**: stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing. Some of these tools are *msfvenom*, *pattern_create* and *pattern_offset*

### `msfconsole`
[[#Table of contents|Back to the top]]

Launch with `msfconsole`

Types of modules
- **Auxiliary**: supporting module (scanners, crawlers, fuzzers, ...)
- **Encoders**: encode exploit/payload to escape signature-based defenses
- **Evasion**: try to evade antivirus software
- **Exploits**: exploit vulnerability for initial access
- **NOPs** - No OPeration: do nothing, used as buffer to achieve consistent payload size
- **Payloads**: code that will run on target
	- **Adapters**: wraps payload to convert into different format (turns payload into a powershell command for instance)
	- **Singles**: self-contained payloads
	  Indicated by "\_": `shell_reverse_tcp`
	- **Stagers**: set up a connection channel between metasploit and target system, allows for smaller initial payload size
	  Indicated by "/": `shell/reverse_tcp`
	- **Stages**: downloaded by stager, allows to use larger payloads
- **Post**: used during post-exploitation


**Example**

`help`

`use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`: starts the use of the exploit eternal blue
We stay in the folder we are in even if the prompt changes

`show options`:
