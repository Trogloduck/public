IT architectures must be built to allow centralized log collection for analysis, monitoring, and incident response

1. **Log Source** Integration
- Ensure all devices and systems (servers, firewalls, routers, switches, applications, etc.) generate logs
- Configure them to forward logs to a centralized collector or management system
2. Select right **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management)
- According to org's needs and scale
- Supports log collection, aggregation, analysis and reporting
3. **Scalability** and **Redundancy**
- Architecture can accommodate growing number of log sources and logs
- Redundancy for availability
4. **Securely transport logs**
- Secure protocols such as TLS/SSL or IPsec from sources to centralized repo
- Authentication and access controls: only authorized devices can send logs
5. **Normalization**
- Standardize log format
6. **Storage** and **Retention**
- Secure storage for appropriate period of time (retention) based on compliance and security requirements

#### Best practices
1. **Continuous Monitoring**:
2. **Threat Intelligence**: stay informed through feeds and services
3. **User Training**
4. **Incident Response Plan**
5. **Security Automation**
6. **Backup and Recovery**
