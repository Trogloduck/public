Most used tools: Nmap, Burp suite, Kali

Types of pentest: white/grey/blackbox

1. **Nmap**: understand network, identify open ports $\rightarrow$ **attack surface**
2. **Burp** suite: web proxy between server and browser, **intercept-inspect-modify** http/s, automated scanner

SAST -- Static Application Security Testing: analyze code for vulnerabilities
Automated, might return a lot of false positives, lacks context

DAST -- Dynamic Application Security Testing: runtime vulnerability detection, external attack simulation
Also automated so lacks context

$\Rightarrow$ Manual testing
