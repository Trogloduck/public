### Types of logs

- **System logs:** associated to OS (hardware, device drivers, system changes, ...)
- **Security logs:** logon/logoff activities
- **Application logs:** related to apps (errors, events, warnings)
- **Directory Service Events:** Active Directory changes/activities (mainly domain controllers)
- **File Replication Service Events:** associated to Windows Servers during Group Policies sharing and logon scripts to domain controllers
- **DNS Event logs:** DNSÂ servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
- **Custom logs:** some apps require custom data storage

### Types of events

- **Error:** significant problem (data/functionality loss)
- **Warning:** not necessarily significant, possible future problem (low disk space for instance)
- **Information:** successful operation of app/driver/service
- **Success Audit:** successful audited security access (successful user attempt to log on to system for instance)
- **Failure Audit:** failed audited security access (failed user attempt to access a network drive for instance)

___
### Event Viewer
>*Right-click Windows button $\rightarrow$ Event Viewer*

![[eventviewer.png]]

1. Event log **providers** hierarchical tree listing
2. General overview of **events** specific to a selected provider
3. **Actions**

>*Right-click on a provider > Properties > **Clear log** $\rightarrow$ adversaries can use this to **erase** their **tracks***

#### Events (middle pane)

**Top part**
![[top_part.png]]

- **Level:** event type (error, warning, information, ...)
- **Date and Time**
- **Source**
- **Event ID:** maps to operation/event (in above image 40962 is related to PS Console Startup), not unique (same ID will have entirely different meaning in another event log)
- **Task Category:** event category, helps organize and filter events

**Bottom part**
![[Pasted image 20250220101424.png]]
*Provides more details on selected event*

#### Actions (right pane)

- **Open Saved Log:** especially useful if remote machine is inaccessible
- **Create Custom View** and **Filter Current Log**: nearly identical, custom view allows to filter across logs
- ...

___
### `wevutil.exe`
*Sift through thousands of events using CLI and scripting*

**`wevtutil.exe [command_name] /?`**: details about usage of command

**`wevtutil qe`**: read events from an event log, log file or using structured query

___
### `Get-WinEvent`
*Can combine events from multiple sources and filter using XPath queries, structured XML queries and hash table queries*

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent

NB: replaced Get-EventLog

Use `Get-Help` to obtain info about syntax

**`Get-WinEvent -ListLog *`**: list all **logs**

**`-ListProvider *`**: list all **providers**
![[Pasted image 20250220140038.png]]
Name: Provider
LogLinks: Log where it's written

**Filter**
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Where-Object { $_.ProviderName -Match 'WLMS' }
```

With large event logs, more efficient to use **`FilterHashtable`**:
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
  LogName='Application' 
  ProviderName='WLMS' 
}
```

(More about [[Hash tables]])

Accepted key/value pairs for Get-WinEvent FilterHashtable parameter
![[Pasted image 20250221094957.png]]

Recommended to to make hash table one key-value pair at a time

Event Viewer provides info to build hash table:

$\downarrow$  $\downarrow$  $\downarrow$

### XPath Queries

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/consuming-events#xpath-10-limitations

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms256115(v=vs.100)

wevtutil and Get-WinEvent support XPath for event filtering

Event Viewer > middle pane > bottom half > Details > XML view provides info to build XPath query:
![[Pasted image 20250221104845.png]]
1st tag of query: `*` or `Event`

`Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*'`

![[Pasted image 20250221104949.png]]
`Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/'`

![[Pasted image 20250221105118.png]]
`Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=100'`

Same command with wevtutil:

`wevtutil.exe qe Application /q:*/System[EventID=100]

Note: `System/EventID=100` is equivalent to `System[EventID=100]`

**`@Name`**: filter by provider: `*/System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]`

**`and`**: Combine 2 queries: `-FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=101 and */System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]'`


XPath for elements within **EventData**

![[Pasted image 20250221110331.png]]
Query for TargetUserName: 
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="System"'
```

To display a certain property, pipe a `Select-Object`

Example:
```Powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="Sam" and */System/EventID=4720' | Select-Object Message, ProviderName
```
