Between [[Transport]] and [[Data link]]

**Routing**: choosing optimal path (and re-assemble data)
- ***shortest***: least amount of devices
- most ***reliable***: least packets lost
- ***fastest*** physical connection: copper vs fiber
--> OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

At this layer, everything is dealt via [[TCP IP]]

Takes information from transport layer to encapsulate [[PDU]] that needs to be sent
De-encapsulates PDU received
