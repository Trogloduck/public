`pip install`: installing something from https://pypi.org/

/!\\ careful what package I install: it can run code as soon as it is installed

Every package has a "setup.py" file that runs as soon as we run the `pip install the_package` command

There is no moderation on pypi.org!

To check the content of setup.py: just download and examine it in VSCode (no pip install)
