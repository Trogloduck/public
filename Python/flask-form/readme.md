This folder is dedicated to a Python project using the Flask library to create a contact form.

The project consists in a contact form collecting and sanitizing input from the user.

When submitting correct information, the user is redirected to a page summarizing the sent information.

The form also includes a hidden input field that acts as a bait for bots. If the field contains input when submitting the form, the client is redirected to a decoy page.
